1️.Getting Real-Time Weather Data
Finding a free API that provides weather data.
OpenWeather asking for ₹800, so you had to switch to WeatherAPI.
Confusion on where to put the API key.

2️.Fetching Data for 300+ Cities
Initial script fetched data for only 96 cities instead of 300+.
Frustration when fewer cities were included.
Need for additional weather parameters (like wind speed, humidity, UV index, etc.).

3️.Saving the Weather Data File
Python throwing PermissionError when saving to E:/hacknite/real_time_weather_data.csv.
Possible issues with folder permissions, file being open, or writing to an external drive.
Had to figure out a different path for saving the file.

4️.API Rate Limits & Errors
API possibly limiting requests per second.
Need to add a time.sleep(1) delay to prevent API blocking.
Some cities failing to fetch data due to API issues
